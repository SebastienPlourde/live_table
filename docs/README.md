## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

LiveTable uses a three-tier architecture that separates concerns and maximizes flexibility:

### Data Layer
- **Simple Tables**: Use `schema: YourApp.Model` for single-table queries
- **Complex Tables**: Assign `:data_provider` for custom queries with joins

### Configuration Layer
- **Fields**: Define what data to display and how (`fields/0` function)
- **Filters**: Configure interactive filtering (`filters/0` function)
- **Options**: Control behavior and appearance (`table_options/0` function)

### Presentation Layer
- **Table Mode**: Traditional row/column layout
- **Card Mode**: Custom card components for rich displays
- **Custom Components**: Override any part of the UI

## üî• Key Features

### Advanced Filtering
- **Boolean Filters** - Toggle states with custom dynamic queries
- **Range Filters** - Numeric, date, and datetime ranges with sliders
- **Select Filters** - Static options or dynamic database queries
- **Transformers** - Ultimate power for complex, stateful filtering
- **Full-text Search** - Search across multiple fields simultaneously

### Smart Data Handling
- **Schema Integration** - Direct Ecto schema support for simple cases
- **Custom Queries** - Full control with joins, aggregates, and computed fields
- **Real-time Updates** - Built for Phoenix LiveView with automatic refresh
- **Performance Optimization** - Efficient pagination and query strategies

### Professional Features
- **Export System** - CSV and PDF generation with background processing
- **Multiple View Modes** - Table and card layouts with complete customization
- **URL Persistence** - Shareable and bookmarkable filtered views
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## üìã Common Use Cases

### E-commerce Product Catalogs
```elixir
# Rich product listings with category filtering, price ranges, 
# stock status, and bulk actions
```

### Admin Dashboards
```elixir
# User management, order processing, and content moderation
# with advanced filtering and export capabilities
```

### Analytics Platforms
```elixir
# Customer analytics, sales reports, and KPI dashboards
# with complex queries and real-time updates
```

### Inventory Management
```elixir
# Stock monitoring, reorder alerts, and supplier tracking
# with automated actions and reporting
```

## üìñ Quick Reference

### Essential Patterns

**Simple Table Setup:**
```elixir
use LiveTable.LiveResource, schema: YourApp.Product
```

**Custom Query Setup:**
```elixir
assign(socket, :data_provider, {YourApp.Products, :complex_query, []})
```

**Field Configuration:**
```elixir
def fields do
  [
    name: %{label: "Name", sortable: true, searchable: true},
    price: %{label: "Price", sortable: true, renderer: &currency/1}
  ]
end
```

**Filter Configuration:**
```elixir
def filters do
  [
    active: Boolean.new(:active, "active", %{
      condition: dynamic([p], p.active == true)
    })
  ]
end
```

### Important Notes

- **Field Keys**: Must match schema fields (simple tables) or select clause keys (custom queries)
- **Filter Imports**: Boolean, Range, and Select are aliased - use directly
- **Renderer Signatures**: `&function/1` (value only) or `&function/2` (value + record)
- **Assoc Option**: Only needed for sorting joined fields in custom queries
